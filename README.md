# Kodluyoruz-Live-Coding
What I had learnt in the kodluyoruz event that took place in 3.10.2024. These are my notes I DO NOT take any credibility for the instructions. 

First: Install pips to install any package we need:

```pip install requests```

in order to update: 

```pip install --upgrade requests```

in order to remove:

```pip uninstall requests```

Let's open a txt file for any package and versions of Python we need. 
- Open a requirements.txt file and add the following:
```google-generativeai
discord.py
python-dotenv```

generativeai -> is for ai and machine learning lib.
discord.py -> for discord bot
python-dotenv -> for safety issues

-Python dotenv usage-

Open a .env file and add environment variables inside. These are key-value pairs, the value can change depending on the environment.
